1) Project name: "Favorite Music Collection"
2) Project idea: "Favorite Music Collection" is a web application that allows you to search for a favorite artist.
I am going to recreate an existing project (a final project that I did for the previous JavaScript course) using React.
 - User's input:  an artist name. 
 - Search criteria:  songs, albums, or videos.
 - Search items displayed per page: 5, 10, 15, or 20
 - Output (depending on the search criteria): List of songs, or videos, or albums
 - Every item will be a clickable link listed with track/video/album name, artist's image 
 - Linck will redirect to a new page where users can listen to songs/watch videos or view an album.
 + If I will have enough time, I would like to use Firebase feature to store a list of favorite artist/songs 
 
 3) Wireframes: I have attached a couple of images to the project, design can be varied. 
 These screenshots are taken from the final project that I did for the previous JavaScript course.
 4) Dependencies: I am going to use free API https://itunes.apple.com. Firebase is optional
 5) Tasks: 
     - Create react app
     - Refactor existing JavaScript project code utilizing Component API
     - Define necessary Components and their dependencies on each other: Home page with an input field, 
       render components with a search result with track names, images, clickable links 
     - Utilize API fetch call
     - Utilize Router API
     - Use CSS 
     - Make sure that app works 
     - Deploy the app
   6) Plan: 1st week - Finalize the final project idea and submit week7-assignment 
            2nd week - Create an app and work on the main components, make sure that everything works as expected. User acceptance testing.
            3rd week - Work on CSS design, deployment
